# Polymorphism 

### How have we used it? 

<p> We have used Polymorphism togheter with Inheritance. We have defined a Method in teh Parent class, WaterVehicle. The created Method will provide its own implementation of this method. </p>

#### WaterVehicle.java 
<p> Add a method to describe the vehicle</p>

``` public class WaterVehicle extends Vehicle {
    int chanceOfSinking;

    public int getChanceOfSinking() {
        return chanceOfSinking;
    }

    public void setChanceOfSinking(int chanceOfSinking) {
        this.chanceOfSinking = chanceOfSinking;
    }

    public WaterVehicle(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, int chanceOfSinking) {
        super(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand);
        this.chanceOfSinking = chanceOfSinking;
    }
    
    // Method to be overridden
    public String getVehicleInfo() {
        return "Water Vehicle: " + getName() + " (" + getModel() + ")";
    }
}
```
#### Boat.java
<p> Override the getVehicleInfo method </p>

``` public class Boat extends WaterVehicle {
    String fishingEquipment;
    String food;

    public String getFishingEquipment() {
        return fishingEquipment;
    }

    public void setFishingEquipment(String fishingEquipment) {
        this.fishingEquipment = fishingEquipment;
    }

    public String getFood() {
        return food;
    }

    public void setFood(String food) {
        this.food = food;
    }

    public Boat(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, int chanceOfSinking, String fishingEquipment, String food) {
        super(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand, chanceOfSinking);
        this.fishingEquipment = fishingEquipment;
        this.food = food;
    }

    @Override
    public String getVehicleInfo() {
        return super.getVehicleInfo() + " | Fishing Equipment: " + fishingEquipment + " | Food: " + food;
    }
}

```
#### Submarine.java

<p> Similiary, overide the getVehicleInfo method</p>

```public class Submarine extends WaterVehicle {
    int maximumDepth;
    int windows;

    public int getMaximumDepth() {
        return maximumDepth;
    }

    public void setMaximumDepth(int maximumDepth) {
        this.maximumDepth = maximumDepth;
    }

    public int getWindows() {
        return windows;
    }

    public void setWindows(int windows) {
        this.windows = windows;
    }

    public Submarine(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, int chanceOfSinking, int maximumDepth, int windows) {
        super(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand, chanceOfSinking);
        this.maximumDepth = maximumDepth;
        this.windows = windows;
    }

    @Override
    public String getVehicleInfo() {
        return super.getVehicleInfo() + " | Maximum Depth: " + maximumDepth + " meters | Windows: " + windows;
    }
}
```
# Inheritance 

<p> We have used Inheritance quite a lot in our Project. The very first class that is Inherited is the Vehicle class. The Vehicle class will be inherited by Water-, Air-, and LandVehicle. Vehicle.java provides the other 3 Classes with the basic attributes every Vehicle needs, no matter where it works. </p>
  
<p> Now After Water-, Air-, and LandVehicle inherited from Vehicle, each and every one of them adds their own attributes the other kind of Vehicle cant use. For example: Water Vehicle implemented the attributes int chanceOfSinking. </p>

<p> We have implemented diffrent kind of Vehicles which Inheritate from their needed class and add their own Attribute. For Example: We created the Class Boat.java. Now Boat.java inheriteds from Watervehicle and WaterVehicle inheritates from Vehicle. </p>

Example with WaterVehicle: 

#### Vehicle.java:

```public class Vehicle {
    private int year;
    private int price;
    private int speed;
    private int ageApproval;
    private int seats;
    private String name;
    private String color;
    private String model;
    private String brand;

    // Constructor
    public Vehicle(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand) {
        this.year = year;
        this.price = price;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.ageApproval = ageApproval;
        this.seats = seats;
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    // Getters and Setters
    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    public void setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }

    public int getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(int price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    public int getSpeed() {
        return speed;
    }

    public void setSpeed(int speed) {
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    public int getAgeApproval() {
        return ageApproval;
    }

    public void setAgeApproval(int ageApproval) {
        this.ageApproval = ageApproval;
    }

    public int getSeats() {
        return seats;
    }

    public void setSeats(int seats) {
        this.seats = seats;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public String getBrand() {
        return brand;
    }

    public void setBrand(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }


    public String getVehicleInfo() {
        return String.format("%s %s (%d) - %s, %s, Seats: %d, Price: $%d",
                brand, model, year, color, name, seats, price);
    }
}
```

#### WaterVehicle.java: 

```public class WaterVehicle extends Vehicle {
    int chanceOfSinking;

    public int getChanceOfSinking() {
        return chanceOfSinking;
    }

    public void setChanceOfSinking(int chanceOfSinking) {
        this.chanceOfSinking = chanceOfSinking;
    }

    public WaterVehicle(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, int chanceOfSinking) {
        super(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand);
        this.chanceOfSinking = chanceOfSinking;
    }


    public String getVehicleInfo() {
        return "Water Vehicle: " + getName() + " (" + getModel() + ")";
    }
}
```
#### Boat.java: 

```public class Boat extends WaterVehicle {
    String fishingEquipment;
    String food;

    public String getFishingEquipment() {
        return fishingEquipment;
    }

    public void setFishingEquipment(String fishingEquipment) {
        this.fishingEquipment = fishingEquipment;
    }

    public String getFood() {
        return food;
    }

    public void setFood(String food) {
        this.food = food;
    }

    public Boat(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, int chanceOfSinking, String fishingEquipment, String food) {
        super(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand, chanceOfSinking);
        this.fishingEquipment = fishingEquipment;
        this.food = food;
    }

    @Override
    public String getVehicleInfo() {
        return super.getVehicleInfo() + " | Fishing Equipment: " + fishingEquipment + " | Food: " + food;
    }
}
```
# Interfaces 

### How we used Interfaces
#### TerrestrialAndAerialBehavior.java: 

<p>The TerrestrialAndAerialBehavior interface defines methods like getTerrainType() and setTerrainType(). This lets us specify what behaviors land and air vehicles should have. </p>

```public interface TerrestrialAndAerialBehavior {
    String getTerrainType();
    void setTerrainType(String terrainType);
}
```
#### LandVehicleBehavior.java: 
<p>The LandVehicleBehavior and AirVehicleBehavior classes implement this interface. They provide their own versions of the methods, allowing each vehicle type to have unique behavior while still following the same structure. </p>

```public class LandVehicleBehavior implements TerrestrialAndAerialBehavior {
    private String terrainType;

    @Override
    public String getTerrainType() {
        return terrainType;
    }

    @Override
    public void setTerrainType(String terrainType) {
        this.terrainType = terrainType;
    }


}
```

#### AirVehicleBehavior.java: 

```public class LandVehicleBehavior implements TerrestrialAndAerialBehavior {
    private String terrainType;

    @Override
    public String getTerrainType() {
        return terrainType;
    }

    @Override
    public void setTerrainType(String terrainType) {
        this.terrainType = terrainType;
    }


}
```
### Why we did an extra class:
<p> By creating a separate behavior class (LandVehicleBehavior, AirVehicleBehavior), we keep the vehicle's structure (attributes like year, price, etc.) separate from its behaviors (like getting terrain type). This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand. </p>

# Design Pattern 

## What it is
<p>The Factory Method Pattern is a design pattern that defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. </p>

## How we used it 
<p>We created factory classes (BoatFactory and SubmarineFactory) to handle the creation of Boat and Submarine objects. </p>

<p>In the Main class, we called these factory classes to create instances of water vehicles instead of creating them directly.</p>

## Why we used it
1. Separation of Concerns:
<p> The factory classes keep the creation logic separate from the main code, making it cleaner. </p>

2. Flexibility:
<p> If we need to add new vehicle types in the future, we can create new factory classes without changing existing code. </p>

3. Maintainability:
<p> Changes in how vehicles are created can be made in the factory classes without affecting other parts of the application. </p>

## Classes 

#### WaterVehicleFactory.java: 

```public interface WaterVehicleFactory {
    WaterVehicle createWaterVehicle();
}
```

#### BoatFactory.java: 

```public class BoatFactory implements WaterVehicleFactory {
    private int year;

    private String color;
    private String model;
    private String brand;
    private int chanceOfSinking;
    private String fishingEquipment;
    private String food;

    public BoatFactory(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, int chanceOfSinking, String fishingEquipment, String food) {
        this.year = year;
        this.price = price;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.ageApproval = ageApproval;
        this.seats = seats;
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.chanceOfSinking = chanceOfSinking;
        this.fishingEquipment = fishingEquipment;
        this.food = food;
    }

    @Override
    public WaterVehicle createWaterVehicle() {
        return new Boat(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand, chanceOfSinking, fishingEquipment, food);
    }
}
```

#### SubmarineFactory.java: 

```public class SubmarineFactory implements WaterVehicleFactory {
    private int year;
    private int price;
    private int speed;
    private int ageApproval;
    private int seats;
    private String name;
    private String color;
    private String model;
    private String brand;
    private int chanceOfSinking;
    private int maximumDepth;
    private int windows;

    public SubmarineFactory(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, int chanceOfSinking, int maximumDepth, int windows) {
        this.year = year;
        this.price = price;
        this.speed = speed;
        this.ageApproval = ageApproval;
        this.seats = seats;
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.chanceOfSinking = chanceOfSinking;
        this.maximumDepth = maximumDepth;
        this.windows = windows;
    }

    @Override
    public WaterVehicle createWaterVehicle() {
        return new Submarine(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand, chanceOfSinking, maximumDepth, windows);
    }
}
```
