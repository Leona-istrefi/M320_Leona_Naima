# UML diagram Vehicle Rental project

## Description
This is a vehicle rental game where you can rent a lot of different vehicles. <br>
For land, water and also air vehicles. <br>
We've implemented the project with multiple interfaces to avoid using the same code several times.<br>
You can see our structure on the pictures, there is a vehicle interface which is extended by the interfaces AirVehicle, WaterVehicle
and also AirVehicle interfaces. Then there are different vehicles such as submarine, car and rocket.
They all have a different price and individual attributes. <br>
There is also a class to create a contract and a class to register the person. To avoid several people renting the same car at the
same time, there are exceptions and exception handling is also implemented for age.
