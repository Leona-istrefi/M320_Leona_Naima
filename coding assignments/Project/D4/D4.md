#### How is it used? 

##### SpaceVehicle.java
<p >This class represents a generic space vehicle and delegates certain behaviors to the SpaceVehicleBehavior class. </p>


```package VehicleRental;

public class SpaceVehicle extends Vehicle {
    private VehicleBehavior behavior;
    public SpaceVehicle(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, String AirPressure) {
        super(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand);
        this.behavior = new SpaceVehicleBehavior();
        this.behavior.setAirPressure(AirPressure);
    }
    public String getAirPressure() {
        return behavior.getAirPressure();
    }
    public void setAirPressure(String AirPressure) {
        behavior.setAirPressure(AirPressure);
    }
}
 ```


##### SpaceVehicleBehavior.java 
<p>  This class contains the logic for behaviors related to space vehicles, such as checking for air pressure.</p>


``` package VehicleRental;

public class SpaceVehicleBehavior implements VehicleBehavior {
    private String AirPressure;
    @Override
    public String getAirPressure() {
        return AirPressure;
    }
    @Override
    public void setAirPressure(String AirPressure) {
        this.AirPressure = AirPressure;
    }
}
 ```

##### Example of subClass (spaceshuttles) 
<p> Here’s how a specific vehicle, like SpaceShuttles, extends SpaceVehicle but doesn’t need to implement airpressure checks itself. It relies on the delegated behavior.</p>

```package VehicleRental;

public class SpaceShuttles extends SpaceVehicle {
    private int walkieTalkie;
    public SpaceShuttles(int year, int price, int speed, int ageApproval, int seats, String name, String color, String model, String brand, String airpressure, int walkieTalkie) {
        super(year, price, speed, ageApproval, seats, name, color, model, brand, airpressure);
        this.walkieTalkie = walkieTalkie;

    }
    public int getWalkieTalkie() {
        return walkieTalkie;
    }
    public void setWalkieTalkie(int walkieTalkie) {
        this.walkieTalkie = walkieTalkie;
    }

}
```

## Generics

### How Generics Work

#### Type Parameters:
<p> Generics use type parameters, which are defined using angle brackets (<>). For example, <T> defines a generic type T.</p>

#### Type Safety: 
<p> Generics provide compile-time type checking, which helps avoid ClassCastException at runtime. This means that you can specify what type of object a class or method can work with.</p>

#### Reusability: 
<p> By using generics, you can write a single class or method that can operate on different types of objects without needing to overload them.</p>

#### Bound Type Parameters: 
<p> You can restrict the types that can be passed as type parameters using bounds. For example, <T extends Vehicle> means that T must be a subclass of Vehicle.</p>

### Contract Class with Generics

```public class Contract<T extends Vehicle> {
    private Person customer;
    private T vehicle; // Generic type T
    private LocalDate startDate;
    private LocalDate endDate;
    private String terms;

    public Contract(Person customer, T vehicle, LocalDate startDate, LocalDate endDate, String terms) {
        this.customer = customer;
        this.vehicle = vehicle;
        this.startDate = startDate;
        this.endDate = endDate;
        this.terms = terms;
    }

    public T getVehicle() {
        return vehicle; // Returns the vehicle of type T
    }

    // Other methods...
}
 ```
### Explanation of Usage

#### Generic Type Parameter: 
<p>The Contract class defines a type parameter T, which extends Vehicle. This means that T can be any subclass of Vehicle, allowing the Contract class to handle various types of vehicles (e.g., Car, Truck, Airplane).</p>

#### Type-Safe Vehicle Handling:
<p>By using a generic type for the vehicle field, the Contract class can store a vehicle of any type that extends Vehicle. This ensures that only valid vehicle types can be used, enhancing type safety.</p>

#### Method Returns:
<p>The method getVehicle() returns a vehicle of type T, allowing the caller to know exactly what type of vehicle they are dealing with, without needing to cast it.</p>
