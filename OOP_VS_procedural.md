# Object oriented programming VS. procedural

## procedual programming <br>
- Solve problems with procedures
- instructions that run in a specific sequence
- variables, decisions and loops 
- can be splitted into subroutines
- function can be used multiple times

## OOP (Object oriented programming) <br>
- focus to solve problem in relation to the real world
- Object is a data structure which is similar to real object
- Objects have data fields, methods, attributes

Object and real world have two characteristics: <br>
all have a state and behaviour. Object oriented way is to identify the state and behaviour of real objects
Complexity of objects can vary
Object stores states in data fields and defines behaviours with methods

## 2 Programming paradigms <br>
They both have a different style how to solve problems with a computer program

## Checkpoints <br>
- I know the difference between procedural and object oriented programming
- I know the word programmparadigma and I have an example
